            <strong> Hon JUDITH COLLINS (Minister of Justice) </strong>
            <strong> : </strong> I move,
            <em>That the Bail Amendment Bill be now read a third time</em> <strong> </strong>. This bill will make it harder for those accused of serious offences to get bail.</p>
            <p class="a">The bill also expands the list of offences where a defendant faces a reverse burden of proof when they are being considered for bail, if they have been convicted of one of these offences before.</p>
